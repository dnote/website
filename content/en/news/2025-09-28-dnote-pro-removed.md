description: "Removing the freemium model to focus on community-driven open source development."
---

In a continued effort to simplify the project, Dnote Pro has been removed. The freemium model was a distraction from the core mission of creating open source knowledge base software. This change refocuses the project on simpler, community-driven development.

Future development will focus on simplification, including replacing PostgreSQL with SQLite to allow running the server as a single binary with no external dependencies. These changes prioritize making Dnote simpler to self-host, develop, and contribute to.
