The server-side source code has been released on GitHub under GPLv3 and AGPLv3 licenses. This completes the open source stack - CLI, browser extension, and Atom plugin were already open source. The release comprises approximately 50,000 lines of code developed over two years, available for users to obtain, study, modify, and redistribute under the license terms.

Open sourcing enhances security through transparency, particularly important for systems using cryptography. Publishing the source code allows public scrutiny and helps identify potential vulnerabilities. Users can now self-host the entire service if desired, while Dnote Pro continues as a hosted option providing automatic updates, patches, security fixes, and data migration.
