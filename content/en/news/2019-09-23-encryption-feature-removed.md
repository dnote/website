The end-to-end encryption feature has been removed to refocus the project on its core mission as a knowledge base. The encryption introduced trade-offs that diminished usability: full-text search was unavailable in the web client, and notes could no longer be embedded in weekly digest emails. These limitations made it harder to retrieve knowledge on-the-go and added friction to the spaced repetition workflow.

An automated migration tool was provided to decrypt existing notes client-side and upload them to Dnote servers. The removal restores full-text search on the web, embedded notes in emails, and password recovery.
