description: "Deprecating spaced repetition to focus on core command line notebook functionality."
---

The project is refocusing on its founding goal of building a minimalist command line note-taking tool. Spaced repetition features are being deprecated based on user feedback. The first release three years ago consisted of around 300 lines of code for quickly writing one-liners to a YAML file. User feedback indicates that most value the simple command line tool for quickly capturing and retrieving information rather than advanced features.

The spaced repetition feature is deprecated in v0.5.0 and scheduled for removal in the next major version. For Dnote Cloud users, the feature will be removed four weeks from announcement (by March 6, 2020).
