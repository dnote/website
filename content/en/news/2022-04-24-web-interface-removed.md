description: "Removing the web interface to focus on the command line tool."
---

To continue simplifying the project, the web interface for note-taking has been removed. It was a distraction from the core mission of building a minimalist command line note-taking tool. The project will focus on the command line interface as the primary way to interact with Dnote. This simplification allows for better focus on core functionality and makes the codebase easier to maintain in the long run.
